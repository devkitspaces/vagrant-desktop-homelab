# Vagrant Homelab Desktop

## Summary

Provide a method of reproducible graphical development environments based on Linux.  This repository provides a base Homelab Desktop environment, sandboxed on your local computer.  

### Usage

You can use this locally with `vagrant up`, calling as such:

```
vagrant --name=mydesktop up
```

However It is recommended to use the script `create.sh` for the first run to ensure all necessary arguments are provided. The provided arguments creates a `settings.yaml`, storing the settings for the machine.  You can create the machine by calling:

```
sh create.sh -n mydesktop -d ubuntu
```

If you want more information about the script `create.sh`, you can do so by calling:

```
sh create.sh -h
```

### Parameters

The parameters are used in the calling of `vagrant up`, primarily as `vagrant [OPTIONS] up`.  After provisioning the environment, a settings file (`setting.yaml`) is created, which stores the provided parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---         |
| name | `string` | Name of the provisioned desktop environment |
| desktop | `filename` | The name of the desktop provisioning script.  These scripts are present in [`packaging/environments`](src/packaging/environments). |

The vagrant environment is based on the `bento/ubuntu` images.  If the timezone is not set, the provision script will attempt to auto-detect the timezone using [`tzupdate`](https://github.com/cdown/tzupdate).

## Components

On first run (`create.sh ...`) the base `bento/ubuntu` image will be downloaded, and the packages for a graphical interface will be downloaded. This will take a significant amount of time to fully setup to become fully installed.  The default user is `vagrant` with password `vagrant`.

### Architecture

The `vagrant-desktop` is meant to be included as a git submodule as part of a `.Workspace` project.  The following is the architecture of a `.Workspace` meta-project:

```
* .Workspace Repository
    * bin
    * lib
    * build
        * build-all.sh
    * Repositories
        * MyHomeLab (git repo submodule)
    * Environments
        * vagrant-desktop (git repo submodule)
    README.md
```

The concept of this architecture is to enabling experimenting with homelab concepts.

### Shared Folders

The `Vagrantfile` makes use of the following shared folders to access files on the host machine.

| Name | Path |  Host Path (relative to `Vagrantfile`) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Repository | /srv/local | ../ | The `vagrant-desktop` repository root. |
| Repositories | /home/vagrant/repositories | ../../../ | The parent directory of the `vagrant-desktop` repository. See [Architecture](#architecture). |

## Development

The `Vagrantfile` is built to act as a bootstrap for more complex vagrant environments that provision a full development environment.  As such, it includes lines for script execution that can be leveraged downstream by other projects.  These scripts are expected within the `provision/` directory.

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| provision-pre.sh | Acts as a pre-hook to the default provisioning script. |
| provision.sh | provision.sh provisions the development environment. |
| provision-post.sh | Acts as a post-hook to the provisioning. |

### Dependencies 

The following are the dependencies of the vagrant project

* `getoptlong` - The [GetoptLong](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/getoptlong/rdoc/GetoptLong.html) class allows you to parse command line options similarly to the GNU getopt_long() C library call.
* `yaml` - The [YAML](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html) module provides a Ruby interface for data serialization in YAML format.
